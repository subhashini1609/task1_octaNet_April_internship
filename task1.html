            <p>Massive floating icebergs, misty mountains, spectacular fjords and one of the best places on earth to see the Aurora Borealis (the Northern Lights) – Greenland is nature at its rawest and most beautiful. However, one thing you’ll quickly notice is that – other than a few fields in the south – Greenland isn’t very green. Instead, vast swaths of ice cover the world’s largest island, most of which is totally uninhabitable. Instead, Greenland’s population is scattered along the ice-free west coast in tiny settlements made up of pastel-coloured huts and houses. Nuuk, the capital, is home to around a quarter of Greenlanders, who always give visitors a warm welcome, despite the frequently bitter cold. From Nuuk, you can arrange boat trips out to sea for some whale watching, or along the rocky coastline, dotted with weathered fishing huts and wooden cabins. Your trip will likely include the chance to go hiking amidst mountains, glacial lakes and cascading waterfalls – an opportunity not to be missed if you’ve ever dreamt of having such a landscape all to yourself. In summer, ice-melting temperatures allow for sea kayaking cruises, even as far north as Sisimiut and Ilulissat, while the colder, snowier months create ideal conditions for activities like dog sledding in the south. Most hotels and guest houses can be found in Nuuk and Ilulissat, with a handful of others available in more remote towns like Kangerlussuaq and Narsaq.</p>
